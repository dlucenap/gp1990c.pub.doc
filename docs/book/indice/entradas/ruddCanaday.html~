Dr. Canaday wrote his first computer program while an undergraduate at Harvard
in 1959. After earning his Ph.D. from M.I.T., Dr. Canaday joined AT&T Bell
Laboratories where he worked for 25 years principally in computer science
research. Before his pioneering work as one of the three inventors of Unix (with
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson), Dr Canaday led a team that built one of the
world's earliest time sharing systems.

After Unix he led these efforts: the first published description of a database
server, the first Bell-labs-wide application of Unix (the Programmers
Workbench), the first AT&T commercial application using Unix, the first
automated directory assistance system, and several other projects.

Dr. Canaday, who also holds the Master of Divinity degree from Union Theological
Seminary New York, left Bell Laboratories to become Assistant Pastor at Vieux
Carre Metropolitan Community Church in New Orleans. However, he soon returned to
software development, founding first SumTIme Software and later, after moving to
San Francisco with his husband, he founded Cima Systems. RHC Software is his
third company. As Chief Scientist and Director of Engineering at RHC Software,
Dr. Canaday continues to invent and build innovative software intended to help
small businesses flourish.
